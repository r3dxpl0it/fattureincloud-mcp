by **[Mediaform s.c.r.l.](https://media-form.it)** — Genova, Italy

MCP server that connects Claude (Desktop, Code, or any MCP client) to **FattureInCloud**, the leading Italian SaaS for electronic invoicing. Manage invoices, credit notes, proformas, clients, suppliers, cost/revenue centers, and supplier expenses through natural language. Italy mandates B2B/B2C e-invoicing through the Sistema di Interscambio (SDI) — this server brings AI-assisted billing to that compliance-driven workflow.

> Marking payments as "paid" is intentionally not exposed: the FattureInCloud API requires a payment account that cannot be reliably retrieved through the SDK. Use the FattureInCloud web panel for that operation.

## Installation

### Option 1 — Claude Desktop (MCPB bundle, recommended)

1. Download the latest `fattureincloud.mcpb` from the [GitHub Releases page](https://github.com/aringad/fattureincloud-mcp/releases/latest).
2. Drag the `.mcpb` file onto Claude Desktop, or use **Settings → Extensions → Install from file**.
3. When prompted, fill in your FattureInCloud API token, company ID, and (optional) sender email.

That's it — no Python setup, no virtualenv.

### Option 2 — Manual install via PyPI

For Claude Code users or any MCP client that reads `claude_desktop_config.json`-style configuration:

Requires Python 3.11 or newer.

```bash
pip install fattureincloud-mcp
```

Then add to your MCP client configuration (for Claude Desktop, `~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json` on macOS or `%APPDATA%\Claude\claude_desktop_config.json` on Windows):

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "fattureincloud": {
      "command": "python",
      "args": ["-m", "fattureincloud_mcp"],
      "env": {
        "FIC_ACCESS_TOKEN": "a/xxxxx.yyyyy.zzzzz",
        "FIC_COMPANY_ID": "123456",
        "FIC_SENDER_EMAIL": "billing@yourcompany.com"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Restart your MCP client after editing the config.

## Configuration

| Env var | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `FIC_ACCESS_TOKEN` | yes | Personal API access token (starts with `a/`) |
| `FIC_COMPANY_ID` | yes | Numeric company ID, visible in the URL when logged into FattureInCloud |
| `FIC_SENDER_EMAIL` | required for `send_email` | Sender mailbox for courtesy copies |
| `FIC_CACHE_DIR` | no | Override cache directory (default `~/.fattureincloud-mcp/cache`) |
| `FIC_CACHE_DISABLED` | no | Set to `1` to disable the local cache |
| `FIC_RUNTIME_DIR` | no | Override the per-interpreter runtime root (default `~/.fattureincloud-mcp/runtime`) |
| `FIC_RUNTIME_LENIENT` | no | Set to `1` to continue past a Python/ABI mismatch instead of exiting |
| `FIC_DEBUG` | no | Set to `1` to include tracebacks in tool error responses |

**How to get the FattureInCloud credentials:** log into [FattureInCloud](https://secure.fattureincloud.it/), go to *Settings → API and Integrations*, create a **Manual Token** with the permissions you need. The `COMPANY_ID` is in the URL after `/c/` once you select a company.

## Usage examples

### Example 1 — Create an invoice for a known client

> "Find client 'Acme Srl' and create a draft invoice for €1,500 + VAT for consulting services in November 2026, payable in 30 days, on revenue center 'Project Alpha'."

Claude will:
1. Call `list_clients` (cached) and pick the matching client
2. Call `list_cost_centers` (cached) to validate `Project Alpha` exists
3. Call `create_invoice` with `client_id`, items, dates, payment terms, and `revenue_center="Project Alpha"`
4. Return the draft number and ask whether to send it to SDI

### Example 2 — Cost-center analysis

> "How much did I bill on the 'Project Alpha' revenue center in 2025? Break down by month."

Claude will:
1. Call `list_cost_centers` to confirm the label
2. Call `list_invoices` for year 2025 (the result includes `revenue_center` per invoice when set)
3. Filter by `revenue_center == "Project Alpha"` and aggregate by month

### Example 3 — Recurring invoices replay

> "Duplicate every invoice issued to 'Recurring Customer Co' in October 2025, set the new dates in November, keep 30-day payment terms."

Claude will:
1. Call `list_invoices` with `query="Recurring Customer Co"` and `month=10`, `year=2025`
2. For each result, call `duplicate_invoice` with `new_date` set in November
3. Return the list of new draft invoices and ask before sending

## Caching

To minimize redundant calls to the FattureInCloud API, this server caches client lookups and the cost-centers list locally as JSON files (default location `~/.fattureincloud-mcp/cache/`, scoped per `company_id`, 24-hour TTL). The cache is transparent: tool signatures don't change.

```bash
# Force refresh:
rm -rf ~/.fattureincloud-mcp/cache

# Disable temporarily:
export FIC_CACHE_DISABLED=1
```

## Cost / Revenue Centers

FattureInCloud uses one shared registry for cost centers (on supplier documents) and revenue centers (on issued documents). With this server you can:

- `list_cost_centers` — read the registry
- `revenue_center="<label>"` — assign on `create_invoice`, `create_credit_note`, `create_proforma`, `convert_proforma_to_invoice`, `update_document`, `duplicate_invoice`
- `cost_center="<label>"` — assign on `create_received_document`

The label must already exist; centers are managed from FattureInCloud's web UI (Settings → Cost Centers). Passing an unknown label returns the list of valid labels in the error message.

## Privacy & Data Handling

- API calls go **directly** from your machine to FattureInCloud's servers (`api-v2.fattureincloud.it`). No data is routed through Mediaform or any third-party server.
- The local cache is plaintext JSON in your home directory. You control it.
- Credentials live only in your `.env` (gitignored), shell, or MCP client `user_config`. They are never logged or transmitted to anyone other than FattureInCloud.
- Full Privacy Policy: **https://media-form.it/privacy-policy.html**
- See also [`docs/PRIVACY.md`](docs/PRIVACY.md) for a mirrored copy of the policy.

## Troubleshooting

### "Couldn't start ... Error: Connection closed"

The server process exited before it could speak MCP. Run the self-check with
the same Python Claude Desktop uses:

```bash
python3 server.py --selfcheck
```

It reports the interpreter, the resolved import paths, whether each dependency
loads, and whether the token and company ID are set.

The most common cause is a **Python version mismatch**. The bundle ships
compiled dependencies for CPython 3.11-3.14; if your `python3` is something
else, build a runtime for it:

```bash
bash scripts/repair-runtime.sh
```

That installs into `~/.fattureincloud-mcp/runtime/<abi>/`, which the server
prefers over its own bundled copy and which survives reinstalling the
extension. Restart Claude Desktop afterwards.

Full background in [`docs/RUNTIME.md`](docs/RUNTIME.md).

### Tools answer "Estensione FattureInCloud non configurata correttamente"

The API token or company ID is missing or malformed. Open the extension's
settings and check both fields; the company ID is the number in the
FattureInCloud URL after `/c/`.

## Known issues

- **Invoice duplication may fail for some clients.** A specific client configuration triggers a failure path that hasn't been reproduced yet. Workaround: duplicate manually from the FattureInCloud web panel. Tracked in [`docs/KNOWN_ISSUES.md`](docs/KNOWN_ISSUES.md) — please report a reproducible case via [GitHub issues](https://github.com/aringad/fattureincloud-mcp/issues).
